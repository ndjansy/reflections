How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?
-------------------------
The staging area is as the name suggest the area where git temporarily posts files to receive the 
commits the user wants to add to said files. The repository is the final landing spot for those commits
made, so they leave the staging area to land in their final spot in the repository.  The working 
directory encapsulates the repository and all the elements within. The staging area in contrast to the 
repository and working directory is a virtual area where commits are temporarily posted before being 
placed back in the repository, akin to a waiting room.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-------------------------
Using git diff I can see the different changes made and in which specific instances they were made, with 
respect to which portion of code.  I can then conclude which change(s) should be packaged in a commit or 
separated.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would 
branches help?
-------------------------
Branches help in keeping history of a project organized by allowing you to work on a parallel project 
, a clone to the main project, while trying out new features to the project without altering the original 
project.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-------------------------
Diagrams help in the visualization of branching through illustrating a tree like structure with the master
serving as the main brannch off of which all the other branches are formed. It also gives a visual of 
the relative length or frequency of branching, which should help analyze the user's project as far as the 
amount of experimentation / breakdowns / or fixes.
