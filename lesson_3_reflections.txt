When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--------------------
A remote repository would be the choice by default in collaborative projects or cases where I want to publicly share work, perhaps
expecting feedback.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
---------------------
I may not be willing to share some of the changes or commits made publicly. Although I can still backtrack if need be with changes on the remote repository, I may want to maintain a specific pattern of development and be unwilling to broadcast everything about my process. In a roundabout way, a form of abstraction. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
---------------------
A fork is a cloning operation of a repository to another within Github. I would use this to coontribute on an open source project hosted within github or tryout experimental code from another contributor. Clones are copies of repositories between local and remote repositories, or between two distinct local repositories. I would make use of this operation is cases where my local work needs to be broadcasted to a team, where other collaborators can work adjacently on my contributions / or project. I would also use the operation to update (push /pull) the status and commits of a repository currently being worked on. Branches would be best used within a repository, to break off from the master chain, in order to experiment with new code for instance.
