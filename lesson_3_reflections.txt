When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--------------------
A remote repository would be the choice by default in collaborative projects or cases where I want to publicly share work, perhaps
expecting feedback.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
---------------------
I may not be willing to share some of the changes or commits made publicly. Although I can still backtrack if need be with changes on the remote repository, I may want to maintain a specific pattern of development and be unwilling to broadcast everything about my process. In a roundabout way, a form of abstraction.
